Problem 13 of chapter 3
=======================

13. Using the code from the preceding three exercises, implement Grahamâ€™s scan
algorithm for the convex hull of a set of 2D points. You can find good
description of what a convex hull (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull) is,
and how the Graham scan algorithm (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_scan)
should work, on Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/).
